        <p>Thanks for checking out our site! <br> <br></p>
        <p>Vinop is a free browser game website that allows you to play some of your favorite classic games. Although these games are relatively 
            simple, their takeaway is significant: anyone can use basic code to create amazing things. Each game was developed following a different 
            tutorial, and nearly all the games featured were written in Vanilla JavaScript. This collaboration was an opportunity to learn about teamwork, 
            work with moving parts, and yes code. We ultimately got to have fun while using our brains. <br> <br></p>
        <p>If our project struck your interest and seemed fun, we encourage you to create something of your own. With so many different tutorials available 
            online, it is easier than ever to start learning how to code. If you create something simple of your own, join our development team and we would 
            love to include your game on our website. You can contact us 
            <a href="mailto: carson.sytner@gmail.com" class=" text-off-white-color lg:hover:text-dark-blue-color underline">here!</a>

            At Vinop, we strive to be as transparent as possible. All of the games here were created following online tutorials, and weâ€™ve provided the 
            links and source code for each project. You can check that out
